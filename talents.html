				<h3>BRIO MARVE</h3>
				<p>
					This young artist breaths surf. His looks, his attitude, everything screams out his passion for surf. A few years ago nobody would have expected this kind of fire in Brio.
					<br><br>
					School, work, sleep, school, work, sleep. Day after day he relived the same boring routine. He dragged himself through life as a bored carcass without any mental activity. Even when his friends asked him to join them on a surftrip to California he wasn’t really enthusiastic. During the trip Brio rediscovered life. That first wave he surfed, changed him forever. Never before he felt so alive and happy.

				<h3>KNEEBREAKER</h3>
				<p>
					- passion can be expressed in many different ways-
					<br><br>
					This artist is either known in music industry as in the world of surfing. Before making music he was one of the most promising surfers from his era. Unfortunately his fate changed within seconds…
					<br><br>
					 Teahupoo, August 16, 2008, The day who would change everything. 
					 <br><br>
					Curl pro, a competition of which every surfer dreams. 20 minutes of complete silence until THE wave appeared. An unexpected beauty reaches the surfers from out of the blue. All competitors paddle for their life but only one was able to catch the enormous wave. Kneebreaker was that one. As a torpedo he rides the pipeline until he disappears. For 23 seconds he is one with the wave, 23 seconds of flying, 23 seconds until the fatal fall. Suddenly the beauty turns into a horrible monster and she spits. Surfboard before surfer, flying before crashing, fin before knee. The same way he was tearing the wave apart, the fin tears his knee apart. Never will he be able to surf again but never will he stop flying. He relives the moment forever. This magic feeling is translated in music.

					<h3>BEN</h3>
					<p>
						- I am on hunt for beauty –
						<br><br>
						BEN is the youngest member of our team. Although his young age, he carries a very special story with him.
						<br><br>
						Santorini, August 11 2014, the fatal lost of words
						<br><br>
						Once upon a time there was a boy whose name was Ben. With his blond hair and deep blue eyes he was the king of charms. A lot of women saw him as the perfect husband, prince charming, the man of their dreams. But ben didn’t care. He only had an eye on one thing: finding ultimate beauty. That night he was enjoying a beautiful sunset. Suddenly he got blinded by a beauty he had never experienced before. A real mermaid was lying in front of his feet. “DJEEZES CHRIST!”, he screamed in a slightly feminine way. After that he wasn’t able to do anything. He could only stare at her. This unconfutable silence caused the mermaid to crawl back in the sea after a while. 6 nights she kept returning to the beach, 6 nights Ben was speechless.  The seventh night the mermaid was tired of Ben’s childish behaviour. “Are you going to do something or what? And stop drooling it’s disgusting! Ugh, I’m out of here…”  And so the mystical creature disappeared into the sea with stretched out middle finger. 
						This scene touched Ben so much that he decided to become an artist. He uses music as a medium to express his appreciation for his mermaid.

				<h3>FLOUTING UNICORN</h3>
				<p>
					-sex and unicorns-
					<br><br>
					Without doubt this is the most special artist of our team. He is the living proof that drugs do have a strong influence on the function of the human brain. AND GOD, we love that influence!
					<br><br>
					Floating Unicorn lived for 10 years in a spiral of MDMA and other mind-expanding stuff. His life was nothing more than sex and unicorns. Nothing was able to change this colourful, though sad existence. Although that’s what everybody thought. Until suddenly he saw the light. A sensation he has never felt before with any drugs. Never had he felt so free and happy as on that moment. That first wave changed his life. That wave broke the spiral forever. 
					<br><br>
					Floating Unicorn shares his story with his music. His hope is to get people on the right path again.
